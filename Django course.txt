	about/  About page
	post/ postid/ Single Post Page

	What is Views: It handle Request & Return Response. 
	views contain logic needed to return a response. 
	
	* Function View (FBVs)

	* Class View (CBVs)

    home/  _________>>_________View____________>>___________ Home page
	   |			 |  			    |
	   |			 |			    |
       Fetch posts	Check Authentication           Return Response
	 from DB


	1. Function Base View(FBV): A in Django is a simple function that handles HTTP requests and returns a response. 
	It is one of the most commonly used methods to define views in Django.
	
	create first view:
	
	1:- view.py

	from django.shortcuts import render
 	from django.http import HttpResponse

	def helloworld(request): // request is HttpRequest
		return HttpResponse("Hello World")
